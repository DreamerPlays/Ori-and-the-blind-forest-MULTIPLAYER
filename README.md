Ori and the blind forest MULITPLAYER

Download the OriMultiplayerPatcher.exe in OriMultiplayerPatcher/bin/Release/ and click the version you have. Choose your assembly csharp in the managed folder in your ori folder. Check if a message with the text: "Patched..." shows up. Start your Ori and go into a save file. Now you will see some textboxes and buttons in the top left. In the top textbox you put your ip and in the bottom one you put the friends one. Then you just click on connect and wait until your friend clicked on connect and then you can click on start sending. Your friend should do the same.

Updates coming soon...
